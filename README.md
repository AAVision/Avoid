# Avoid-Me 
Annoying GUI Application V1.0 <br/><br/><br/>
![alt text](https://github.com/AAVision/Avoid/blob/master/12.jpg?raw=true)

-> It's an application that can generate 2 new forms after closing the main form. <br/>
-> It can add itself to the startup. <br/>
-> I'm looking in the next version to hide it from the task manager. <br/>
-> All this work is for educational purpose. <br/>
