# Avoid
Annoying GUI Application 
![alt text](https://github.com/AAVision/Avoid/blob/master/12.jpg?raw=true)

It's an application that can generate 2 new forms after closing the main form <br/>
It can add itself to the startup <br/>
I'm looking in the next version to hide it from the task manager <br/>
All this work is for educational purpose <br/>
